# Opal-Fare-Calculator
A Java Application that accepts 4 user's opal fares for Sunday (not greater than 2.7), reads the input text files containing pre-written data of opal fares from Monday to Saturday of 4 Users and finally prints out the data of all seven days fares in a tabular format and also generates the Output File in the destination where the file is running from. 

To run this application, you should have any Java installed and settuped on your system. 

To run simply download the code zip files, extract it to the folder you want.

Open cmd (I have a windows so I say cmd, if you have Mac - use terminal), then test if your system has java by typing jpath, after that type javac, if everything goes fine then type javac FinalJavaOpalUser.java (as of file to run the application).

Finally, if everything goes ok, type java FinalJavaOpalUser and hit enter. Hurrey! we run the Application.

Thanks for downloading the code.
